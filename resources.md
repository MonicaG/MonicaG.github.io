#Resources

Here is what I read/listen/watch in order to try to keep current.  I don't attempt to consume all of these in a day or week; I just skim through and pick out what interests me. 

Is there anything missing from my list?  I'm interested in knowing what other developers do to keep current.  Please leave me a note in the comments section below!
