desc: Why I am taking the Introduction to Mathematical Thinking class
---

I’m starting 2017 by taking Coursera's [Introduction to Mathematical Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking) class. In my [previous post](/blog/other/2016-reflections/) I noted I should focus on programming projects. I realize I am distracting myself from that goal. However, I am taking this class for the following reasons:

* The goal of the class is to develop “outside-the-box thinking”.  I hope it will give me new ideas on how to approach algorithms, bugs and programming problems. 
* I want to cultivate the skills needed to tackle job interview questions. By starting now I hope to build a solid foundation of knowledge. I do not want to cram before the interview process.
* The class ends March 19, 2017. I will then focus the rest of the year on programming projects.
