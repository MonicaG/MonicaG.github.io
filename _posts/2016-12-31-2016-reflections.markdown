What I did in 2016:

* Created [BCDevExBot](https://twitter.com/bcdevexbot) twitter bot
* Contributed to [mozilla web qa bot](https://github.com/mozilla/webqabot)
* Helped my Dad with his wordpress website ([http://cowichanbowmen.com/](http://cowichanbowmen.com/))
* Volunteered at a [Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com/) Wordpress workshop
* Played around with [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) and made two small plugins:
	* [hubot-credit-card-number-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-credit-card-number-generator)
	* [hubot-lmgtfy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-lmgtfy)
* Worked on problems on [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
	* Competed in the [Ad Infinitum 16 (First timers)](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/infinitum16-firsttimer/challenges) competition
	* Completed the [30 days of code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) challenge
* Wrote a blog entry each month


Postitives:

* I coded!
* My python knowledge has improved.
* I contributed a small amount to open source.
* My command line skills have improved.

Negatives:

* I did not have a focus.  I split my time among coffee script (hubot), wordpress and python.
* The time spent on hacker rank distracted me from doing another project.  
* Nothing gets done in December.  It is all illness and family functions.

What I can do to improve in 2017:

* Focus on projects. Come up with a plan on what I want to work on and stick to it.
* Pick a language to focus on. 


Happy New Year!
