TL;DR - delete Time Machine local snapshots to free up space.

Does anyone else find installing XCode frustrating? I always need more free disk space, especially when installing a beta. This was the case when I downloaded XCode 13 Beta 5 from the Apple Developer Downloads page. When I tried to extract the xip file I got an error stating:

> "The archive XCode_13_beta_5.xip can't be expanded because the current volume doesn't have enough free space."

I deleted XCode simulators and cache files to free up space with the following steps:

* Go to Apple icon -> About This Mac 
* Click on 'Storage' tab
* Click 'Manage' Button
* In the Developer menu delete:
  * the XCode Cache file
  * old iOS and watchOS Device support files


I also delete unused applications, log files, and music to clear up space. After much pruning, I had over 100GB free. Still, the Archive Utility app complained there was not enough free space!

 This seemed odd. I tried the solution proposed in this blog post: [Installing Xcode with ‚Äúnot enough disk space available‚Äù](https://medium.com/geekculture/installing-xcode-with-not-enough-disk-space-available-b96c8f17115b). It didn't work for me. But I suggest trying it out.

However, the blog post did lead me to check my disk space using the Disk Utility app (Applications -> Utilities -> Disk Utility). It reported I only had ~25GB free when the "About This Mac" storage screen reported I had ~100GB.

 After some googling I found this question on StackExchange: [macOS not showing the actual free space](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/324440).  The answers said to delete Time Machine local snapshots. I did so, and *boom*, the Disk Utility app reported I had 100GB free. I tried the Archive Utility app again. This time it expanded the xip file and installed XCode Beta! Yay!

The commands I used to list and delete the time machine files were (from [this answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/352511/432763)):

```bash
$ tmutil listlocalsnapshots /
com.apple.TimeMachine.2021-08-20-195949.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2021-09-08-114353.local

 $ tmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2021-08-20-195949
 $ tmutil listlocalsnapshots /
 com.apple.TimeMachine.2021-09-08-114353.local
 ```

Why is there a discrepancy between the free space reported by the About This Mac and the Disk Utility apps? Because [macOS will automatically delete snapshots when space is needed](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204015). So, About This Mac considers the space used by local snapshots as available. Therefore, it reported ~100GB free space. However, the Disk Utility does **not** consider snapshots as free space. The snapshots are using space so Disk Utility reports that space as used. So, it reported there was only ~25GB of free space.

The Archive Utility also does **not** consider the storage used by snapshot as free space. It checks for disk space before extracting the file and, in my case, detected that only ~25GB was free. By deleting the local snapshot, it was able to expand the xip file and install XCode Beta.
