# About

I programmed professionally for 10+ years.  My background is in enterprise Java development. I worked on systems that included e-commerce, finance and inventory management.

I currently run around after my little ones. I still like to program though. So, in my copious spare time (ha!) I work on my own hobby projects and contribute to OSS projects. I am using this time to expand beyond Java and play with other languages and technologies. This blog is part of that learning process.
