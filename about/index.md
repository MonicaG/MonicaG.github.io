# About

I programmed professionally for 10+ years. My background is in enterprise Java development. I worked on systems that included e-commerce, finance, and inventory management.

I took a break from paid work to run around after my little ones. Now I create my own projects. My most recent project is [Barbell Helper](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/barbell-helper/id1509605376?ls=1); a standalone Apple Watch app. Please see my [projects](/projects) page for more of my work.

This blog is my space to write about what I learn during my coding journey.
