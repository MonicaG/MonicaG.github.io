#About

I programmed professionally for 10+ years, but am currently running around after my little ones.  I still like programming though, so in my copious spare time (ha!) I work on my own hobby projects and contribute to OSS projects.  

My background is in enterprise Java development.  I am using this time to expand beyond Java and play around with other languages and technologies.  This blog is part of that learning process.
