# About

<div class="about-contact"> {% include contact.html %}</div>

I programmed professionally for 10+ years.  My background is in enterprise Java development. I worked on systems that included e-commerce, finance and inventory management.

I currently run around after my little ones. I still like to program though. So, in my copious spare time (ha!) I work on my own hobby projects and contribute to OSS projects. I am using this time to expand beyond Java and play with other languages and technologies. This blog is part of that learning process.

Somethings that I like or use are:

**Newsletters**
	
* [devops weekly](http://www.devopsweekly.com) - weekly devops news.  
* [O'Reilly Programming Newsletter](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/newsletter.csp) - General programming news and trends.
* [Technology Radar](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) - Twice a year report on trends in technology.


**Podcasts**
	
* [Full Stack Radio](http://fullstackradio.com) - A podcast "about everything from product design and user experience to unit testing and system administration".
* [Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net/) - A podcast targeting professional software developers.  It has good indepth discussions on a variety of topics.
* [Under The Influence](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence) - A podcast about marketing and its influence on consumers and culture.  


**Tools**

- **IDE** - I've used Visual Age, JBuilder, Eclipse and JetBrains.  I am a fan of the JetBrains development tools.  I like using an IDE because I am forever refactoring and I like the integrated debugging tools.
	* [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
	* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)	
- **Shell**
	* [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) - handy for jumping to a directory no matter where you are.
	* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) - replacement for the OSX terminal app.
	* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) - I use the [bureau](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes#bureau) theme.  I use git from the command line and like seeing the status of the repo at the command prompt.
- **Text Editors**
	* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - Very slick and has many plugins.
	* [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) - I am by no means a master, but can usually fumble my way through.  I do not partake in the great war between vim and emacs users. Vim works for me for the limited things I do.
- **Time tracking**
	* [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) - I've started time tracking my personal projects.  This app seems to do the trick.  The free account allows for 2 open projects at a time, which is sufficient for me.  The timer on the Mac menu bar makes it handy to start and stop.
